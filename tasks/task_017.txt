CLEAN STREAMLINED APPROACH:

- Install Swift toolchain and VSCode Swift extension
- Create Swift Package Manager project: `swift package init --type executable`
- Configure Package.swift with macOS platform (minimum 13.0) and SwiftUI dependencies
- Set up basic project structure: Sources/, Tests/, Package.swift
- Create main.swift entry point with basic SwiftUI app structure
- Set up folder structure: Sources/Models/, Sources/Services/, Sources/Views/, Sources/Utilities/
- Configure VSCode workspace settings (.vscode/settings.json) for Swift development
- Add launch.json for debugging in VSCode
- Test basic build with `swift build` and verify debugging works
- Verify SwiftUI app can launch and display basic window

This eliminates the unnecessary Xcode project creation step and focuses on the VSCode workflow from start to finish.
